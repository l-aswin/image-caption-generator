#Image Caption Generator
An Image Caption Generator AI Project involves developing a deep learning model that automatically generates descriptive captions for images. 
It combines computer vision to interpret visual content and natural language processing (NLP) to generate meaningful text. 
The project typically uses a convolutional neural network (CNN) for image feature extraction and Transformer model for caption generation.
